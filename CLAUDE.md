# Project Rules

## Post-Task Verification

After completing any task, you MUST:

1. **Run lint check** - Ensure no new lint errors or warnings are introduced:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

2. **Run build** - Ensure the build completes successfully:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

If either check fails, fix the issues before considering the task complete.
